## My process

I started by creating the HTML structure and then I added the CSS styles. I started by creating the main container and gave him round corners. I added the QR code img inside of it and the text. I place the container in the center of the screen with absolute positionning. I added the background color and the shadow. I added the font for the text and made small aesthtics adjustements.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned how to center a div in CSS with absolute positionning. I also learned how to use the box-shadow property.
